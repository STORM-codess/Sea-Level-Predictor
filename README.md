# Sea-Level-Predictor

In this project, I analyzed a dataset on global average sea level changes from 1880 to predict future sea level rise by 2050. Using Pandas, I imported and cleaned the data from the EPAâ€™s sea level dataset, then created a scatter plot with Matplotlib to visualize the trends.

Key steps included:

Plotting the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level against the Year to explore historical sea level changes.

Applying the linregress function from SciPy to calculate the line of best fit, projecting sea level rise through 2050.
Generating an additional line of best fit from 2000 to the present to predict future trends based on recent data, comparing the two projections.

This analysis highlights the historical context of rising sea levels and the potential future impacts, using data-driven insights to inform climate change discussions.

Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
